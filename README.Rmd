The goal of r2dii.plot is to help you plot 2DII data in an informative,
beautiful, and easy way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of r2dii.plot from
[GitHub](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.plot) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.plot")
```

## Example

The r2dii.plot package is designed to work smoothly with other "r2dii" packages
-- [r2dii.data](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.data/),
[r2dii.match](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/), and
[r2dii.analysis](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/). It also
plays well with the popular packages [dplyr](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), which help you prepare your data and
customize your plots.

```{r setup}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(r2dii.plot)
```

Your data typically comes from the output of two functions in the r2dii.analysis
package:
[`target_sda()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/reference/target_sda.html)
and
[`target_market_share()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/reference/target_market_share.html).
Here you'll use two example datasets that come with r2dii.plot.

```{r}
sda

market_share
```

r2dii.plot supports three kinds of plots -- timeline, techmix, and trajectory.

### Timeline

Use `plot_emission_intensity()` with `sda`-like data. You'll need to pick the
specific rows you want to plot. For details see the documented "Requirements" of
the argument `data`, or try intuitively and let the error messages guide you.

```{r error = TRUE}
plot_emission_intensity(sda)
```

The error message suggests you must first pick only one value of `sector`, for
example "cement".

```{r}
sda %>% 
  filter(sector == "cement") %>% 
  plot_emission_intensity()
```

Great! You can now polish your plot. Your options are limitless but these are
some typical things you may do:

* Pick a narrower time range.
* Extrapolate the timeline.
* Add a title. 

```{r}
data <- filter(sda, sector == "cement", year >= 2020)

plot_emission_intensity(data, extrapolate = TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "Timeline plot")
```

You can further customize your plot by adding a custom manual scale using 
`ggplot` function `scale_colour_manual()` with custom legend labels. 

```{r}
data <- filter(sda, sector == "cement")

plot_emission_intensity(data, extrapolate = TRUE) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#4a5e54", "#a63d57", "#78c4d6", "#f2e06e"),
    labels = c("Proj.", "Corp. Economy", "Target (demo)", "Adj. Scenario (demo)")
  )
```

### Techmix

Use `plot_techmix()` with `market_share`-like data. Again, learn which rows to
pick by reading the documented "Requirements" of the argument `data`, or by
trial and error.

```{r error = TRUE}
unique(market_share$metric)
chosen_metrics <- c("projected", "corporate_economy", "target_sds")

data <- market_share %>%
  filter(
    metric %in% chosen_metrics,
    sector == "power",
    region == "global"
  )

plot_techmix(data) + 
  labs(title = "Techmix plot")
```

You may customize the plot further by:

* Setting custom colours and colour labels, using
`ggplot2::scale_color_manual()`.
* Picking the range of years to plot, by filtering the data passed to
`plot_techmix()` (instead of the full range by default).

```{r error = TRUE}
data <- market_share %>%
  filter(
    metric %in% chosen_metrics,
    sector == "power",
    region == "global",
    between(year, 2020, 2025)
  )

plot_techmix(data) + 
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("black", "brown", "grey", "blue", "green4"),
    labels = paste(c("Coal", "Oil", "Gas", "Hydro", "Renewables"), "Cap.")
  )
```

### Trajectory

Use `plot_trajectory()` with `market_share`-like data. Again, learn which rows
to pick by reading the documented "Requirements" of the argument `data`, or by
trial and error.

```{r}
data <- market_share %>% 
  filter(
    sector == "power", 
    region == "global", 
    technology == "renewablescap",
    year <= 2025
  )

plot_trajectory(data) + 
  labs(title = "Trajectory plot")
```

Use the `main_line` argument to indicate which trajectory line should be most
visually salient (solid black line) -- it's "projected" by default but the next
plot sets it explicitly for demonstration.

Use `normalize = FALSE` if you prefer not to normalize to the start year.

```{r}
plot_trajectory(data, main_line = "projected", normalize = FALSE)
```
