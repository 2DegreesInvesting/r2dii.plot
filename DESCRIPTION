Description: These tools help you to assess if a financial portfolio
    aligns with climate goals. They visualize key climate indicators
    attributed to the portfolio (e.g. production, emission factors), and
    calculate alignment targets based on climate scenarios.  They
    implement in R the last step of the free software 'PACTA' (Paris
    Agreement Capital Transition Assessment;
    <https://2degrees-investing.org/>). Financial institutions use 'PACTA'
    to study how their capital allocation decisions align with climate
    change mitigation goals.
