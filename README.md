The goal of r2dii.plot is to help you plot 2DII data in an informative,
beautiful, and easy way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of r2dii.plot from
[GitHub](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.plot) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.plot")
```

## Example

The r2dii.plot package is designed to work smoothly with other “r2dii”
packages –
[r2dii.data](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.data/),
[r2dii.match](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/), and
[r2dii.analysis](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/).
It also plays well with the popular packages
[dplyr](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), which help you prepare your
data and customize your plots.

``` r
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(r2dii.plot)
```

Your data typically comes from the output of two functions in the
r2dii.analysis package:
[`target_sda()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/reference/target_sda.html)
and
[`target_market_share()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/reference/target_market_share.html).
Here you’ll use two example datasets that come with r2dii.plot.

``` r

r2dii.plot supports three kinds of plots – timeline, techmix, and
trajectory. Each plot has specific requirements for the first argument
`data`. To meet those requirements we currently provide two experimental
sets of functions ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)s) – X and Y.

Both APIs can help you get the same plots. The difference is not in what
you can do but in how you can do it:

  - The X API has a simpler interface. It focuses exclusively on the
    tasks you can’t easily achieve with other packages, and assumes you
    can meet the `data` requirements and customize your plots with other
    packages such as base R, dplyr, and ggplot2. It forces you to learn
    or reuse your existing knowledge of other R packages and workflows.

  - The Y API has a more complex but complete toolkit. It offers more
    functions and arguments that wrap features from other packages to
    help you meet the `data` requirements and customize your plots
    directly with r2dii.plot. and ggplot2. It forces you to learn the
    new r2dii.plot way of doing things but requires little knowledge of
    other packages and workflows.

These tables summarize the differences for users and developers of
r2dii.plot:

|                                                | X API               | Y API                                         |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Interface                                      | Simpler             | More complex                                  |
| Meet `data` requirements                       | With other packages | With r2dii.plot and optionally other packages |
| Customize plots                                | With other packages | With r2dii.plot and optionally other packages |
| Integrates with other R packages and workflows | More                | Less                                          |

*The X and Y APIs compared from a user’s perspective.*

|                  | X API | Y API |
| :--------------- | :---- | :---- |
| Easy to maintain | Less  | More  |
| Easy to extend   | More  | Less  |

*The X and Y APIs compared from a developer’s perspective.*

To make the comparison concrete consider this small example of a
trajectory plot (the other plot types you can find in the detailed [X
API](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.plot/articles/articles/r2dii-plot-X.html)
and [Y
API](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.plot/articles/articles/r2dii-plot-Y.html))
articles. Notice the resulting plot is almost the same (except for the
labels) but the toolkit is different.

  - X API

<!-- end list -->

``` r
data <- market_share

prep <- filter(
  data,
  sector == "power",
  technology == "renewablescap",
  region == "global",
  scenario_source == "demo_2020",
  year <= 2025
)

plot_trajectoryX(prep) + 
  labs (title = "Trajectory plot with the thin 'X' API")
```

  - Y API

<!-- end list -->

``` r
data <- market_share

prep <- prep_trajectoryY(
  data,
  sector_filter = "power",
  technology_filter = "renewablescap",
  region_filter = "global",
  scenario_source_filter = "demo_2020",
  value = "production"
)

scenario_specs <- dplyr::tibble(
  scenario = c("sds", "sps", "cps"),
  label = c("SDS", "STEPS", "CPS")
)

main_line_metric <- dplyr::tibble(metric = "projected", label = "Portfolio")

additional_line_metrics <- dplyr::tibble(
  metric = "corporate_economy",
  label = "Corporate Economy"
)

plot_trajectoryY(
  prep,
  scenario_specs_good_to_bad = scenario_specs,
  main_line_metric = main_line_metric,
  additional_line_metrics = additional_line_metrics
) + 
  labs (title = "Trajectory plot with the thick 'Y' API")
```
