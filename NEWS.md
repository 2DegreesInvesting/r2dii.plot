# r2dii.plot (development version)

* `plot_trajectory()` now plots the main line on top of all other lines, so
it's no longer hidden when it overlaps with other lines (#221).

* `plot_techmix()` for the "automotive" `sector` is now coloured so that the
darkest colours corresponds to the least sustainable technology, i.e.
consistently with other technologies. This pattern of decreasing
sustainability is now also reflected in the order of the legend labels (#328).

# r2dii.plot 0.0.1

* Initial release.
