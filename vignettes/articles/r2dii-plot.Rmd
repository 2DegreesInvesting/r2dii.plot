```

The goal of r2dii.plot is to help you plot 2DII data in an informative,
beautiful, and easy way. It is designed to work smoothly with other "r2dii"
packages -- [r2dii.data](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.data/),
[r2dii.match](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/), and
[r2dii.analysis](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/). It also
plays well with the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package, which
helps you customize your plots.

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(r2dii.data)
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.plot)
library(r2dii.analysis)
```

Your data should have a structure similar to that of the demo datasets in the
r2dii.data package.

```{r}
loanbook <- loanbook_demo
ald <- ald_demo
scenario <- co2_intensity_scenario_demo
region <- region_isos_demo
```

Your workflow involves functions from the packages r2dii.match and
r2dii.analysis.

```{r}
matched <- loanbook |>
  match_name(ald) |>
  prioritize()  # Remember to validate matches (see `?prioritize`)
```

* Use `plot_emission_intensity()` with `sda`-like data.

```{r}
matched |>
  target_sda(ald, co2_intensity_scenario = scenario) |>
  subset(sector == "cement") |>
  plot_emission_intensity()
```

* Use `plot_trajectory()` with `market_share`-like data.

```{r}
matched |>
  target_market_share(ald, scenario = scenario_demo_2020, region_isos = region) |>
  subset(technology == "renewablescap" & region == "global") |>
  plot_trajectory()
```

* Use `plot_techmix()` with `market_share`-like data.

```{r}
matched |>
  target_market_share(ald, scenario = scenario_demo_2020, region_isos = region) |>
  subset(
    sector == "power" & 
      region == "global" &
      year >= 2020 &
      year <= 2025 &
      metric %in% c("projected", "corporate_economy", "target_sds")
  ) |>
  plot_techmix()
```
